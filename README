A repository creating simple implementations showing how to use
the Apache Commons DbUtils functionality.

This project was created within Eclipse, therefore will work
best in Eclipse.  However, you don't need to use Eclipse if you
don't want to, it'll work fine either way.

Run the Simple class, making sure that both the jar files in
the lib/ directory are in your classpath.  It's a command line
interface, and it outputs some basic information to STDOUT.

You'll need to set up a MySQL database as described within
the javadoc of Simple.  You'll need some data in it too, and
again, this is described in the javadoc.
